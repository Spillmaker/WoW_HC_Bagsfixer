# WoW_HC_Bagsfixer
Tired of looking at the same old six slots bags? While this cant help with increasing the slots, it certainly will make your bags look better.

# Say what?
Generally this just overrides the default icons for bags, and replaces them with the onyxia backpack icon.

# But how?
Download [THIS](https://github.com/Spillmaker/WoW_HC_Bagsfixer/releases/download/1.0.0/WoW-HC_Bagsfixer.zip) zip-file and make sure that the folder called "ICONS" is placed in the folder "Interface" in your wow folder. It DOES NOT go into the AddOns Folder.

# And then?
Restart the game. (Reload wont work)

# What bags this works on?
It works on all bags, except the primary bag, and i didnt add the profession bags. (Herb bags, Soulstone bags, etc)

# Anything else i should know about?
Type !claim in esfands chat for a surprise.
